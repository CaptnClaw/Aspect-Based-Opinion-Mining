# Aspect-Based-Opinion-Mining
This project focuses on aspect-level opinion mining (explicit aspects) and incorporates syntactic unsupervised approach for it. It is used to extract most important aspects of the product along with the opinion words describing that aspect. The sheer volume of online reviews makes it difficult for a human to process and extract all meaningful information in order to make an educated decision. Our approach does not require any seed word or domain-specific knowledge of the product. The result of the project will show the extracted aspects from the reviews, various opinion words describing that aspect and its rating. The rating of aspects will be done with the help of sentiment scores from the lexical resource, SentiWordNet. The review dataset will be collected from various ecommerce websites.
